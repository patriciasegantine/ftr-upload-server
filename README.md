# Upload Widget Server

A Node.js server developed as part of a **postgraduate course in Full Stack Development**, focusing on building a robust and scalable file upload system using **Cloudflare R2** as an alternative to **Amazon S3**.

## 🎓 Academic Project

This project was developed during a postgraduate course in backend development, with emphasis on:

- Advanced backend architecture patterns
- Cloud storage integration strategies
- Modern Node.js and TypeScript best practices
- Production-ready development workflows

## 🚀 Overview

The project explores backend best practices such as:

- File upload handling and report generation
- API documentation and validation
- Error handling and streaming
- Unique ID generation
- Docker setup and containerisation
- TypeScript configuration for an efficient development environment

This project does not focus on CRUD operations, assuming prior knowledge of them.
